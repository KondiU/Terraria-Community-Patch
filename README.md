# Terraria Community Patch

## 🌳 Experience Terraria to the fullest!

The goal for this project is to gather all the best Terraria Vanilla+ mods and resoure packs that backports deleted and abandoned features or expand on it's existing ones in a small but pleasant way. If you know any other additions that would fit nicely in this collection, [feel free to propose them in comments](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/comments/2962676851) or [on the issues tab!](https://github.com/KondiU/Terraria-Community-Patch/issues)

This project combines the work of many different artists and modders, but is fully maintained by a single person. If you really enjoy it and would want to support the future of it, [you can buy me a small coffee here. I would gladly appreciate it!](https://ko-fi.com/kondiu)
